## What can a Double do for me?
Anything legal. We strive to get shit done for you. Throw us anything and if we figure we couldn't complete it ourselves, we'll research alternatives and project manage the execution for you.

## What is Double's working hours?
During the pilot period, we will be online from 10am-6pm Mon-Fri at your time zone. We are working towards around-the-clock availability.

## Wait. How could one Double be working around the clock?
We will eventually have more than one Double serving you. Our system enables any Double to pick up where it was left off. [David](mailto:david@askdboule.com) is created as an alias that allows you to refer to in your external email conversations.

## How much is it going to cost me?
We are still figuring it out but as a pilot customer, you will enjoy deep discount when we launch. Weâ€™d love to hear your thoughts on pricing.
